-- Fix Reviews RLS Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- Step 1: Check if reviews table exists
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'reviews';

-- Step 2: Create reviews table if it doesn't exist
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.reviews (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    property_id UUID REFERENCES properties(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    client_email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5) NOT NULL,
    review_text TEXT,
    is_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Step 3: Drop all existing policies to start fresh
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can read verified reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Property owners can see all their reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can see their own reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can insert reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Property owners can update their reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Property owners can delete their reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all operations on reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Reviews are viewable by everyone" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Property owners can see all reviews" ON reviews;

-- Step 4: OPTION 1 - Disable RLS completely (Easiest fix)
ALTER TABLE reviews DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Step 5: OPTION 2 - If you want to keep RLS enabled, uncomment these lines:
-- ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- 
-- -- Very permissive policies for testing
-- CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on reviews" ON reviews
--     FOR ALL USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Step 6: Test the setup
SELECT 'RLS fix completed' as status;

-- Step 7: Check RLS status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'reviews';

-- Step 8: Test table access
SELECT COUNT(*) as review_count FROM reviews;

-- Step 9: Show table structure
SELECT 
    column_name, 
    data_type, 
    is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'reviews' 
AND table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Instructions:
-- 1. Run this entire script in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- 2. The script will disable RLS on the reviews table
-- 3. This will allow review submissions to work
-- 4. Test your review submission in the app

-- Alternative: If you want to keep RLS enabled, uncomment the lines in Step 5
-- This will create very permissive policies that allow all operations
